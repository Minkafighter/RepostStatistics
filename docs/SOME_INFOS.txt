BLACKLIST:
Add userIDs to the blocked.txt / unblocked.txt files to blacklist/unblacklist imgur users.
This files are both read , handled and cleaned at each startup.
To get the imgurid use the imgur_finduserid_user.js with greasemonkey (firefox) or tampermonkey addon (chrome).
The userid is visible on messages near the date.

LOCK FILE:
I use a lock file to avoid running twice at the same time. If the app crashes it might leave the lockfile and thus make starting impossible.
In that case just remove the .lock file.
